## Battle Cards (Use Against Competitors)

### vs Expensive Enterprise Solutions (Forcepoint, Symantec)

**Their pitch:** "Enterprise-grade, comprehensive solution"

**Our response:**
- "Yes, and you're paying 3-6x more for features you don't need"
- "We give you 94% accuracy at €50K/year vs their €150K-€300K"
- "Setup: 30 minutes vs their 2-3 weeks"
- "Questions: What's your current false positive rate? (Usually 15-20%)"
- **Closing:** "Let's prove our accuracy with a 2-week pilot at zero cost"

### vs Competitors With AI

**Their pitch:** "We use AI too"

**Our response:**
- "Which AI model? (Most use older BERT or GPT, we use optimized DistilBERT)"
- "What's your latency? (They usually say "1-2 seconds", we say "200ms")"
- "Does it work offline? (Most require internet/API calls, we're 100% local)"
- "Cost per file? (We're free, they charge per API call)"
- **Closing:** "We can run a speed test. You'll see the difference immediately."

### vs DIY/Open-Source Solutions

**Their pitch:** "We can build this ourselves"

**Our response:**
- "How long? (Usually 6-12 months + hiring expensive engineers)"
- "Cost? (€500K-€1M+ when you factor in engineering time)"
- "Maintenance? (Monthly retraining, model updates, security patches)"
- "Support? (Who do you call when it breaks at 3am?)"
- **Closing:** "€50K/year for production-ready vs €1M+ to build. Do the math."

### vs Budget Concerns

**Their pitch:** "It's too expensive for our budget"

**Our response:**
- "What's your data breach risk? (Show them: avg €4.5M incident cost)"
- "How many employees? (Show ROI: €50K for 200 people = €250/person/year)"
- "What's your current cost? (No DLP = unlimited risk + incident costs)"
- "Financing? (Offer monthly payment plans: €4K/month vs large upfront)"
- **Closing:** "A single prevented breach pays for 90 years of PRITRAK"

---

## Objection Handling (Answers Ready)

### "We already have a DLP solution"

**Response:** "Great. Can I ask—are you happy with it? (Most say no)
- How many false alerts per day? (If >50, we can cut it by 90%)
- What's your deployment complexity? (If weeks, we do it in 30 min)
- Total cost of ownership? (If €150K+, we save them €100K/year)"

**Closing:** "Let's do a side-by-side accuracy test. Worst case, you keep your current tool."

### "We don't have budget"

**Response:** "I understand. Two questions:
- What's the cost of one data breach? (€4.5M average)
- How much would you pay to prevent it? (Usually €50K is obvious choice)
- When do you want to start? (Creates urgency)"

**Closing:** "PRITRAK pays for itself before your first incident."

### "We need to evaluate other vendors"

**Response:** "Absolutely. Here's what to compare:
- Speed: How fast do they classify files? (Ask for <500ms benchmark)
- Accuracy: What's their false positive rate? (Ask for <5% target)
- Cost: Total cost of ownership over 3 years? (Including support, training)
- Deployment: How long to full rollout? (Ask for realistic timeline)
- Privacy: Does it work offline or send data to cloud? (Privacy-critical)"

**Closing:** "You'll find we win on speed, accuracy, cost, and privacy. Let's do a pilot."

### "We need management approval"

**Response:** "Perfect. What does management care about?
- Security? (We prevent 94% of data leaks)
- Cost? (€50K/year vs €150K+ for alternatives)
- Implementation time? (30-minute deployment vs 2-3 weeks)
- User experience? (Zero friction, <200ms latency)
- ROI? (Break-even in 6-8 months)"

**Closing:** "Let me prepare an ROI slide. What's most important to them?"

### "Can it handle our specific file types?"

**Response:** "What file types are you concerned about?
- We handle: Word, Excel, PDF, images, code, databases, emails
- For custom types, we can add custom keywords/regex patterns
- AI model improves monthly with your data
- We can train on your specific classification rules"

**Closing:** "Most companies find we handle 95% of their files. Let's test your specifics."

## Discovery Questions (Ask These First)

1. **Understand their pain:**
   - "What data breaches have you experienced? How much did they cost?"
   - "How many DLP alerts do you get daily? How many do you actually investigate?"
   - "What's your biggest data loss risk today?"

2. **Understand their process:**
   - "How do you currently classify sensitive files?"
   - "Who manages your DLP policies? How often are they updated?"
   - "Do you have integration with SIEM/SOAR tools?"

3. **Understand their requirements:**
   - "How many employees need protection?"
   - "What languages do your documents use? (We support EN/FR)"
   - "Do you need on-premises or cloud deployment?"
   - "What compliance standards do you follow? (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001)"

4. **Understand their decision process:**
   - "Who will make the final decision? (CFO, CISO, both?)"
   - "What's your budget range? (Gets them to commit)"
   - "What's your timeline? (If urgent, move faster)"

## Closing Techniques

### Technique 1: Trial Close ("Assumptive Close")

"Based on what we discussed, PRITRAK seems like a great fit. How soon could you start a 2-week pilot? Should we begin with your Finance department as a pilot group?"

**Why it works:** Assumes "yes" and moves to logistics.

### Technique 2: ROI Close ("Paint the Picture")

"Let me paint a scenario: You deploy PRITRAK next month. By Month 3, you've blocked 47 unauthorized data transfers. If even one of those was a real breach, you've saved €4.5M. PRITRAK costs €50K. That's an 9000% ROI. Can we get started?"

**Why it works:** Makes the financial case irresistible.

### Technique 3: Alternative Close ("Either/Or")

"The question isn't IF you need DLP, it's HOW SOON you need it. Do you want to start with a pilot this month, or wait until you have a breach? I'd recommend the pilot."

**Why it works:** Forces a decision between two positive outcomes.

## Email Templates

### Template 1: Cold Email

```
Subject: 94% Accuracy. No More False Alerts.

Hi [Name],

Most DLP solutions have 15-20% false positive rates. That means 80+ alerts per day that waste your time.

PRITRAK is different. We use AI to achieve 94% accuracy—so you only see real threats.

Key stats:
- 10x faster than competitors (200ms vs 2 seconds)
- 6x cheaper (€50K/year vs €150K+)
- 30-minute deployment vs 2-3 weeks
- Works completely offline (zero data leaves your computer)

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see how this works?

Best,
[Your Name]
PRITRAK
```

### Template 2: Follow-Up Email

```
Subject: Your data is at risk (let me explain)

Hi [Name],

Quick thought: A single data breach costs companies an average of €4.5M.

PRITRAK prevents those breaches by automatically classifying sensitive files in real-time.

Instead of 100+ false alerts per day (that you ignore), you get 30 high-confidence threats (that you investigate).

Would this be valuable for your organization?

### Template 3: Discovery Email

```
Subject: Questions before our call

Hi [Name],

Before our call, I'd like to understand your situation better:

1. How many data loss incidents have you had? 
2. What's your current false positive rate with your DLP?
3. How long does it take to deploy new DLP policies?
4. Do you have budget for security tools this year?

Just quick answers—no need for detailed responses.

Looking forward to our call,
