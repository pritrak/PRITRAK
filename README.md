## 💡 Classification Levels

```
PUBLIC
  └─ No risk (README, marketing, empty files)
  └─ Action: ALLOW

INTERNAL
  └─ Low risk (internal memos, system logs)
  └─ Action: ALLOW with logging

CONFIDENTIAL
  └─ High risk (customer data, financial reports, meeting notes)
  └─ Action: WARN USER

RESTRICTED
  └─ Critical risk (API keys, passwords, trade secrets)
  └─ Action: BLOCK by default
```

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Employee Action** - Tries to open/email/move a file
2. **Agent Intercepts** - PRITRAK agent intercepts in real-time (<50ms)
3. **AI Classification** - DistilBERT model analyzes file (100ms)
4. **Pattern Detection** - Regex scans for credentials, PII (50ms)
5. **Risk Assessment** - Context-aware scoring (30ms)
6. **Decision** - PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED
7. **Action** - Allow/Log/Warn/Block + notify user

**Total Time:** <250ms (unperceivable to user)

## 📈 Business Case

### Year 1 Revenue Forecast (Conservative)

```
Month 1-2:   Setup phase (0 customers)
Month 3:     3 customers × €80K ARR = €240K annual
Month 4-6:   +2 customers/month = 15 customers
Month 7-12:  +1 customer/month = 21 customers

Y1 Total: €250K-€500K
Y2 Forecast: €1.5M-€3M
Y3 Forecast: €4M-€8M+
```

### Break-Even
- **Timeline:** Month 6-8
- **Requirement:** 8-10 paying customers
- **Customer Acquisition Cost:** €5K-€15K
- **Lifetime Value:** €250K+ per customer
